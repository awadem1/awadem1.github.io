		  </center>
  <p> <b>For this project we made mandalas using Adobe Photoshop. To complete this project I follow the instructions as they were given. At one point I did fall behind on instructions so I went into the Google Classroom and caught up. For my base I used a flower for my base. I used light and dark purple and blue for my project. I noticed that my shape kept mirroring. </b> </p>

  <h3>Art Piece #2 - Canva Art</h3>

	</center>
	  <p> <b>I used the program Adobe Express to make a collage of  this I feel is my ¨aesthetic¨. I started by finding pictures online and downloading them which was a bit time consuming because the files kept duplicating and some of the files were not compatible with Adobe Express, so I had to make the collage as I searched for pictures. I included the pictures that I did because purple and blue have always been my favorite colors and I find them soothing. I think my collage matches my aesthetic because I´ve been a fan of elements of the earth like the ocean whilst also liking technology and lights.</b> </p>

	</center>
	  <p> <b>In order to complete this project I went on the copyright free website we were told to go and I chose
about 3 photos. The reason why I chose more than one photo was that I had a backup incase if I
didn’t like how it was turning out. When initially started the project I used a photo that was very
edited and dark and I could just tell it probably would have been that great so I ended up choosing
one of my other photos. The photo I ended up with was a picture of autumn leaves falling off a tree.
To complete the project I followed the directions as they were being given and ended up with the
		  final piece.</b> </p>

	  <p> <b>To start off the
project I found a picture of the artist I wanted to use, downloaded it and opened it in Photoshop.
After it was opened I cropped it as I was told and followed all the instructions that were given.
When it came to choosing the color swatches I chose about 6 swatches (2 different colors for
the hair, 2 for skin tone,1 for lips and 1 for clothes.) When It came to applying the color
swatches I made individual streaks of color for the hair and filled in the clothes that she was
wearing. After that I filled in the skin and I tried my best to do some shading.</b> </p>
