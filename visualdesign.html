  <h3>Art piece #1 - Mandalas</h3>
  <img src="vaMandalapros.png" width="345" height="345" alt="Mandala"/>
  <p>For this project we made mandalas using Adobe Photoshop. To complete this project I follow the instructions as they were given. At one point I did fall behind on instructions so I went into the Google Classroom and caught up. For my base I used a flower for my base. I used light and dark purple and blue for my project. I noticed that my shape kept mirroring. </p>

  <h3>Art Piece #2 - Canva Art</h3>

	  <p>I used the program Adobe Express to make a collage of  this I feel is my ¨aesthetic¨. I started by finding pictures online and downloading them which was a bit time consuming because the files kept duplicating and some of the files were not compatible with Adobe Express, so I had to make the collage as I searched for pictures. I included the pictures that I did because purple and blue have always been my favorite colors and I find them soothing. I think my collage matches my aesthetic because I´ve been a fan of elements of the earth like the ocean whilst also liking technology and lights.
