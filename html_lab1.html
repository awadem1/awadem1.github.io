<h1>General Knowledge </h1>

  <h1>During BECA</h1>
<p>I've spent both middle school and now high school in BECA. During the time I've spent here I've made some friends and learn alot of things I'll use in the real world    </p>

  <h1>After BECA</h1>
  <p>After graduating I plan to go to college and get my bachelors degree. As of right now I don't know what I'll be majoring in or what I'll come to be in life. But do want learn some social and life skills before I really start my life.  </p>
